# Loops 2 Exercise

<b>Instructions:</b>

In this next task, we want you to write a simple program that, given a name, searches an array of objects containing names and phone numbers (`phonebook`) and, if it finds the name, outputs the name and phone number into the paragraph (`para`) and then exits the loop before it has run its course.

You are given three variables to begin with:
- `name` — contains a name to search for
- `para` — contains a reference to a paragraph, which will be used to report the results
- `phonebook` - contains the phonebook entries to search.

Note: You should use a type of loop that you've not used in the previous task [Loops 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Test_your_skills:_Loops#loops_1).
