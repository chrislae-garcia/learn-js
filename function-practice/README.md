# Function Practice 

Write each function and test the output with `console.log().`
- Write a function called add7 that takes one number and returns that number + 7.
- Write a function called multiply that takes 2 numbers and returns their product.
- Write a function called capitalize that takes a string and returns that string with only the first letter capitalized. Make sure that it can take strings that are lowercase, UPPERCASE or BoTh.
- Write a function called lastLetter that takes a string and returns the very last letter of that string:
  - lastLetter("abcd") should return "d"
