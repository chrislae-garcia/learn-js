# Loops 3 Exercise

<b>Instructions</b>

In this final task, you are provided with the following:

 - `i` — starts off with a value of 500; intended to be used as an iterator.
 - `para` — contains a reference to a paragraph, which will be used to report the results.
 - `isPrime()` — a function that, when passed a number, returns `true` if the number is a prime number, and `false` if not.

You need to use a loop to go through the numbers 2 to 500 backwards (1 is not counted as a prime number), and run the provided `isPrime()` function on them. For each number that isn't a prime number, continue on to the next loop iteration. For each one that is a prime number, add it to the paragraph's `textContent` along with some kind of separator.

Note: You should use a type of loop that you've not used in the previous task ([Loops 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Test_your_skills:_Loops#loops_1) and [Loops 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Test_your_skills:_Loops#loops_2)).
